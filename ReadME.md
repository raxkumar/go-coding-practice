## Use-case of go routines and channels

Imagine you are building a concurrent web scraper. You want to fetch the HTML content of multiple web pages concurrently and process the results. Each web page fetching will be simulated by a goroutine, and the HTML content will be communicated back to the main goroutine using channels.

Here are the steps to implement:

1. Create a slice of URLs of web pages you want to scrape (e.g., ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2", ...]).

2. Create a channel to communicate the HTML content of each web page (e.g., chan string).

3. Launch multiple worker goroutines, each responsible for fetching the HTML content of one web page.

4. Each worker goroutine should send the HTML content to the channel.

5. The main goroutine should process the received HTML content (e.g., count the number of words, extract specific information) and print the results.

Ensure that the main goroutine waits for all worker goroutines to finish.

This example demonstrates how to use goroutines and channels to concurrently fetch and process web page content. You can extend this use case by adding more complex processing steps based on your specific requirements.


## generics

The statement "allow you to write functions and data structures that can operate on different types without sacrificing type safety" refers to the benefits of using generics in a programming language. Let's break down the meaning of this statement:

Functions and Data Structures:

In programming, functions and data structures are essential building blocks of software.
Functions encapsulate behavior, and data structures organize and store data.
Operate on Different Types:

Traditional functions and data structures in programming languages are often designed to work with specific types.
With generics, you can write functions and data structures that are parameterized by one or more types, allowing them to operate on a variety of types.
Without Sacrificing Type Safety:

Type safety is a property of a programming language that ensures that the types of variables are checked at compile-time, preventing certain kinds of errors.
Generics, when used correctly, maintain type safety even when working with different types.
Benefits:

Flexibility: Generics allow you to write more flexible and reusable code. Instead of duplicating code for different types, you can create generic functions and data structures that adapt to the types you use them with.
Reduced Code Duplication: Without generics, you might need to duplicate code for similar functionality that operates on different types. With generics, you can write the logic once and apply it to various types.
Maintained Type Safety: Despite the ability to work with different types, generics ensure that type safety is still maintained. Type errors can be caught at compile-time rather than at runtime.

## go.sum

the check is created based on the content of the source code, 
now lets say teh authoer have altered the code with out changing the version's the checksum would change 
so as end you we will know that there is something wrong!
